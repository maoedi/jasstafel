Jass board to count the points while playing Jass simply with the Android smartphone or tablet.

It is possible to write the points at the Schieber, Coiffeur, Differenzler, Molotov and other Jass types. 


*************************

For all boards it is possible to have several profiles. Settings and scores are stored independently. For example, you don't have to delete an unfinished round to be able to play Jass with other players. Even if different rules are used depending on the composition, this can easily be solved by a profile.

The current profile can be shared by AndroidBeam (NFC) simply with another device. For this the board of one device has to be open and the devices have to be held back to back. This is helpful, for example, when the battery is empty or when complex profile settings have to be made.
